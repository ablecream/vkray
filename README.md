# vulkan-ray-tracing

## ‚ú® Overview

**VKRay** is a minimal yet extensible ray tracing engine developed using Vulkan.
The goal of this project is to understand path tracing and real-time acceleration structure management, all while keeping the architecture clean and modular.

This project serves as both a learning tool and a prototype engine for real-time global illumination experiments.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Real-time ray tracing using Vulkan RT extensions
- Acceleration structures (BLAS / TLAS) for performance
- Dynamic scene updates and camera controls
- PBR materials and custom shading
- Clear separation of rendering pipeline stages
- Cross-platform CMake support

## üöÄ How to build
To compile this project, you will need the following libraries
 - Vulkan
 - GLFW
 - [stb (for image loading)](https://github.com/nothings/stb)

Run the following command to build the project
```
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./vulkan_ray_tracer
```
